# 🧘 Memeo

Become a master at memorizing anything you would like.
Using simple [flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard).

Memeo let's you create card decks with as many cards you want.
When practicing a card you can rate your confidence level. Thereby you can get a better overview of your progression.
This can be ideal when studying for an exam or learning a language.

Memeo is a work in progress, but the live version is functional and will remain so.
